## Contribute
Version 1 was focused on the basic information that you'd need for travel. The goal is not to recreate Expedia or another travel app, but provide all the relevant information
for your in park visit. If you'd like to help either conceptually or with coding assistance, please contact me via the email address below. Ideas for future developments include: expanding information gathered from NPS API (activities etc) and another API source for recreational businesses in the area.
